The issue is solved by ensuring the parent container of the element using `calc()` has a defined width.  If you're using percentages, make sure the parent container also has its width explicitly set or inherits a defined width from its ancestors. Alternatively, consider using viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) or other absolute units instead of percentages in the `calc()` function, if the intended behavior is independent of the parent container's size.
